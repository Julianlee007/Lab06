# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 1 below_

##The ratio in sizes of the bars are not the same as the the ratio between the number of speakers. Also potentially problematic is the use of the , as a decimal point as this is not used the same worldwide.



## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 2 below_
##The use of similar shades of grey make it hard to determine the countries. There are no numerical labels or legends which makes it impossible to extract values. It's not clea which dimension corresponds to which data. For example, the angle may be the population density or the total area. 



## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Write your comments about image 3 below_

## The graph does display both axes clearly, however representing each country with its country code may make it confusing to identify that country. Overlapping circles also make it hard to read which countries overlap with each other. However the visualization makes it easier to identify extremes.


## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Write your comments about image 4 below_
##Disrespecting the data as there is no proper variable associated with the y-axis and the x-axis is scaled unevenly. Disrespecting audience and data as the data visualisation does not give a clear message about the data as some data may be hidden due to overlapping and the awkward shapes of the curves.




# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?

Wide format data is where the variables are on the different columns and the values are in the rows. In long format data the first column will identify the observation and the second column will have a row for each pair of observation and variable. The value corresponding to the observation and that variable will be in the third column.

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?


How many observations are there in the data set?




## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}

staff_long <- staff %>% pivot_longer(cols = "1975":"2011", names_to = "year", values_to = "percent")

```

#staff_long <- staff_long %>%
#  mutate(year = ______(year))
